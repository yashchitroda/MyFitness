<h1 align="center">FAQ'S To MY-Fitness</h1>
<button class="accordion">What is Yoga?</button>
<div class="panel"style="font-size: 20px; text-align:justify;">
  <p>The most popular definition of yoga, from the Yoga Sutra, written over 2,000 years ago, is Chitta Vritti Nirodha - simply put, the unknotting of the knotted mind.
That is the process of yoga and the methods used are varied.
The author of Yoga-sutra is Patanjali often identified with the serpent that coils himself around Shiva's neck. It is believed that Lord Shiva revealed Yoga to his student Patanjali, who, in turn, shared it with the world. Patanjali is famous for putting Yoga Asanas together, in a simple comprehensive way.</p>

<button class="accordion">What are the negative effects of yoga?</button>
<div class="panel"style="font-size: 20px; text-align:justify;">
  <p><li>When done under competent supervision yoga will only be beneficial. Before starting your practice however, do check with your doctor if you have any medical conditions.</li>
<li>A lot of postures, including all inversions, are avoidable for someone suffering from hypertension.</li>
<li>Similarly for someone with arthritis, extreme posturing should be completely avoided.</li>
<li>Make sure your trainer is certified and has all this knowledge of dos and don'ts.
<li>Also do not rush into doing advanced postures and that could result in serious injuries.</li>
<li>Focus on developing strength, flexibility and mobility first.</li></p>
</div>
<br>

<button class="accordion">What age should you start yoga?</button>
<div class="panel" style="font-size: 20px; text-align:justify;">
  <p>Kids can be introduced to yoga as soon as they are able to understand simple instructions to perform the poses.

For meditative yoga, the kids need to be slightly older.

Although it will be very individualistic but broadly speaking somewhere seven to nine years of age the kids are generally able to sit still and do basic meditation.</p>

<button class="accordion">Do I Need To Work Out Every Day?</button>
<div class="panel" style="font-size: 20px; text-align:justify;">
  <p>No, you do not need to work out every day. In fact, in most cases, I would recommend at least 1-2 days of total rest a week. However, just because you have a rest or recovery day scheduled into your calendar, doesn't necessarily mean you aren't active at all on these days. Light, regular movement such as walking your dog around the block, or taking time for stretching or foam rolling are great recovery techniques to help increase blood flow and reduce tension in tight muscles. Participating in regular rest days and practicing a well-balanced recovery routine can help you reduce your risk for injury and promote the longevity of your fitness routine.</p>
</div>
<br>

<button class="accordion">How Long Should I Work Out For?</button>
<div class="panel" style="font-size: 20px; text-align:justify;">
  <p>In general, your workouts do not need to be long to be effective. Many people who are new to fitness imagine slogging around for hours on the treadmill. This doesn't need to be the case.
The length of your workout will largely depend on your fitness level, as well as the type of training and intensity you're working out at. The CDC recommends at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity 5 days a week, as well as 2 full body strength training sessions</p>

<button class="accordion">What's The Best Diet For My Fitness Goals</button>
<div class="panel" style="font-size: 20px; text-align:justify;">
  <p>Your diet plays a huge role in the overall success of your new routine. Regardless of your goals, it's important to give your body the fuel and energy it needs to crush and recover from your workouts. There are tons of diets out there, and really when it comes down to it, the choice is personal. If I can give a general piece of advice, it would be to simply focus on including more whole foods in your diet. You can always stay updated with our <a href="plandiet.html">Diet Planner</a></p>

<button class="accordion">How Often Should I Rest?</button>
<div class="panel" style="font-size: 20px; text-align:justify;">
  <p>Your rest will depend on your workout schedule. Like I said previously, I recommend 1 or 2 full days of rest in your schedule. This isn't only great for giving your body time to recover for your workouts, it also can be a great time for self-care to promote mental health.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">How does exercise help mental health?</button>
<div class="panel" style="font-size: 20px; text-align:justify;">
  <p>Research has shown that exercise can help to reduce stress, improve your self-confidence, alleviate anxiety and improve concentration. Plus, it releases endorphins, which encourage feelings of happiness.
Be careful not to over train, as this can put your body and mind under stress, raising levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Therefore a balanced exercise plan is key.</p>

<button class="accordion">How do I get a six-pack?</button>
<div class="panel" style="font-size: 20px; text-align:justify;">
  <p>Doing 100 sit-ups a day won't guarantee a defined set of abs; you'll need to do a combination of things. Reducing body fat should be first on the agenda  you may have the strongest set of abdominal muscles but if your body fat percentage is too high, you won't be able to see them.
Be sure to include some fat-burning HIIT training and cardio in your routine. However, diet is arguably the most important factor if you want to get lean.</p>

<button class="accordion">Why can't I gain weight?</button>
<div class="panel" style="font-size: 20px; text-align:justify;">
  <p>If you are not gaining weight, you are not eating enough and are not reaching a calorie surplus. You must eat more.
It doesn't matter how much you think you're eating. It doesn't matter what your TDEE calculator says. It doesn't matter what your food logs say. If you're not gaining weight or getting bigger, it's not enough. You must eat more. You don't need any specific foods to do this  take what you're already eating, and eat more of it.
Keep in mind that bodyweight can fluctuate by up to 5 pounds or more in a day due to food, urine/feces, water retention, and glycogen, and you should be tracking a trend over at least a month before worrying. Just because the scale went up yesterday and down today does not mean you actually lost weight or your progress. Furthermore, remember that you do not want to be gaining weight too rapidly  muscle is built slowly even in the best conditions, and if you eat too much extra you will just get fat.</p>

<button class="accordion">Should I Do Cardio First
or Weight Training First?</button>
<div class="panel" style="font-size: 20px; text-align:justify;">
  <p>It depends on the client's goals. Many personal trainers think that performing strength training before cardiovascular exercise will augment the amount of fat used during the cardio workout because the strength training will deplete the muscles store of carbohydrates (glycogen). However, strength training is not likely to deplete glycogen stores, because a lot of the workout time is spent resting between sets and exercises. Even if the strength workout were long and intense enough to accomplish this task, exercising in a glycogen-depleted state has many negative consequences, including an increase in acidic compounds produced in response to low carbohydrate levels, low blood insulin, hypoglycemia, increased amino acid (protein) metabolism, increased blood and muscle ammonia and a strong perception of fatigue. Currently, no research shows that strength training immediately before a cardio workout increases the amount of fat used during the cardio workout, or vice versa.</p>
</div>
<br>

<button class="accordion">What Is the Best Way to Lose Fat?</button>
<div class="panel" style="font-size: 20px; text-align:justify;">
  <p>The simple (and complex) answer is that there is no "best way" to lose fat. Each client will respond differently to a training program. However, there are some principles fitness professionals can apply when designing their clients programs.
Activities that incorporate many muscle groups and are weight bearing use more calories per minute and are therefore better suited for fat loss than non-weight-bearing activities that do not use many muscles.
It is often assumed that low-intensity exercise is best for burning fat. During exercise at a very low intensity, fat does account for most of the energy expenditure, while at a moderate intensity, fat accounts for only about 50 percent of the energy used. However, since the number of calories used per minute is much greater at a moderate to high intensity than at a low intensity, the total number of calories expended during a moderate- to high-intensity workout is greater than it is during a low- intensity workout of the same duration; consequently, the total number of fat calories expended is also greater during the higher-intensity workout. </p>

<button class="accordion">How Much Weight Should I Use When Strength Training?</button>
<div class="panel" style="font-size: 20px; text-align:justify;">
  <p>When strength training, it's important to always remember that the workout you're performing is 'your workout'. Don't focus on the amount of weight others are using to complete workouts. Instead, focus on your rate of perceived exertion on a scale of 1 to 10. When strength training, you should feel a perceived exertion of 7 to 9, each rep should feel challenging with the last reps and sets feeling significantly harder. If you complete a workout and aren't feeling challenged, you know it's time to move up in weight the next time you complete that workout.</p>
